The design concept for this assisgnment is to redesign the homepage for CSS Zen Garden, by grouping all of the most important information into specific areas on the page. As shown in my wireframe, I have grouped the design selction menu, archives and resources into lists on the left side of the page and all of the descriptive information about CSS will be contained in text boxes from the top to bottom of the page. I will also incorporate a simple monochromatic color scheme throughout the page in order for users to focus on the information.
This design will impact the user by displaying information in a way that is user friendly. Key concepts will be aparent for users when visually scanning the webpage from left to right. 
One of my inspirational websites is http://www.csszengarden.com/073/. The design is simple and I like the way that the developer grouped each element on the webpage. The most important infomration is displayed on the top portion of the webpage.
